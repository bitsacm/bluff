GET '/login' => First we'll check if user is already logged in or not, We'll Generate Auth URL and would redirect user to that URL if user is not logged in( decided by jwt token stored in cookie), else will send a object {message : "You are already logged in"}

GET '/redirect' => With the help of Middleware we would check auth code ( generated by '/login' route) and in case if auth code would not be there then response would be an error object with status code of 400, otherwise access token will be generated from auth code, then we will check if user's email is present in our database or not and if it's not there then we will create new user along with that jwt token will also be generated and will be saved in db( it would help us in logging user out from a particular device) and cookie will also be created.

GET '/profile' => With the help of middleware we'll first check that if jwt token and email address both present in the cookie are not tampered by the user, if they are tampered then we will send an error object with status code of 400,
and if jwt token is not present than we'll send and error object with status code of 401, and if everything is fine we'll send response as {'email' : }

GET '/logout' => Same verification as in case of '/profile' route, and if everything is fine we'll log user out from his current device and delete token from db.

GET '/logout/all' => Same verification as in case of '/profile' route, and if everything is fine we'll log user out from all the devices and delete all the tokens
