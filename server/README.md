- after sucessfull sign in, we would save user's google id in database and create a cookie containing that id(hashed and salted). then it would be redirected back to '/auth/google/home'

- here we authenticate and will set that cookie to req.user object so that we could id for further use with user.then we would be redirected to '/result' route.

- at result route,we would check is user logged in if he is logged in we would render 'index.ejs' else we would redirect it to 'login' route
